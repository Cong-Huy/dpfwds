What Is This
============
This program will work as the Socks proxy, 
and forward proxy requests to the remote.
It is just like the OpenSSH's ssh client with -D option.


How To Try
==========
$ cd pdfwds
$ sbt
> update
> compile
> run com.jcraft.dpfwds.DPfwdSGUI

The GUI will have four text fields,
  * bind address
  * socks port
  * ssh destination: user@host
  * ssh password

Press "Connect" button, then config your web browser to
use that socks proxy.
